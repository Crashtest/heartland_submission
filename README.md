# Submission for Trent Himes


This is a beginning. It is certainly not a pristine, polished project.
But it should show you a sample of how I think and code.

Here are a few thoughts I had while going through the assignment:

  - I've never used WebdriverIO or TypeScript before and I feel like I need to give a shout-out to my good friend Google for helping me get started
  - I ran into a bug with Cucumber and IntelliJ which caused me some grief. [Thanks Jetbrains](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360009460680-Gherkin-Cucumber-Plugins-Not-Working). 
  - The steps to support the Gerkin code is not complete, but hopefully it will be apparent where I was going. I would be happy to complete the code, but my 48 hour deadline is up.


Thank you for your consideration. I honestly had fun going through the exercise and hope to talk to you sometime soon.

-Trent Himes
